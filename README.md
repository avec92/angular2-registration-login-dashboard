Angular 2 User Registration and Login Example

It logs in if the user exists and asks to register if the user doesn't. On opening, it shows the profile dashboard where you can see who is registered and also can delete it. I studied some tutorials to create this app.

I also took (just like in the tutorials), angular quickstart as a base to build the application from (https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html). Also, I don't know backend working of things and am familiar with using only restAPI links, I followed suit and made a fake backend structure.

To run the app one must have Node.js
Open Command prompt and type the following:
1. npm install
2. npm start

The app will run automatically in localhost:3000.
